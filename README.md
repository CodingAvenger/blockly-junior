### Blockly Junior

Here you can find some icons that can be used in [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), the web-based, graphical programming editor.

The purpose of these icons is making Blockly more easy for young children that have not learned to read yet (3-5 year-olds), converting it to something similar to [ScratchJr] (http://www.scratchjr.org/), which is a simpler version of [Scratch] (https://scratch.mit.edu/).
